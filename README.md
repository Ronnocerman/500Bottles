home screen. From this screen, the user will be able to either
sign up for an account and log in by clicking on the respective
buttons at the top of the screen.

After the user has clicked the SIGN UP button on the home screen, 
a new view will appear with the sign up form. On this form, the 
user will provide the appropriate and correct information in 
order to properly register for an account. After signing up,
the user will be redirected to their freshly minted dashboard 
and from there, they will be able to navigate to the rest of the 
functions of the application.

For this test, please use the above information in section
i. Tester Login Info when signing up for an account.


  A02. Log In

Once an account has been created, the user will be able to click
on the LOG IN button from the home screen and enter the e-mail 
and password associated with their account in order to access
their personal account.


  B00. User Dashboard

When the user logs in or signs up for an account, they will be 
redirected to their personal dashboard. From here, they can either
navigate to the other features of the application (Wine Search, Wine
Wizard, or Cellar), or they can view abbreviated versions of each.


  B01. Short Search

By typing in a keyword associated with a particular wine they are 
interested in into the search bar, the user can perform a very
broad search and return a list of wines that related to that keyword.


  B02. Cellar Graph

Next to the search bar, a graph will display the percentage contents of 
the user's Cellar and compare how many of each type of wine (red, white,
rose, or other) they have stored.


  B03. Abbreviated Cellar
  
At the top of the view, the user will be able to see their most recent 
additions to their Cellar.


  C00. Wine Search

By clicking WINE at the top of the page from their dashboard, the user 
will be redirected to the advanced search page. The user will be able
to enter the name, type, varietal, and winery of a desired wine (or 
any combination of these variables) in order to search our database
for said wine. After the search results have been returned, the user
can favourite a wine, add it to their Cellar, and give it a rating if
desired.


  D00. Wine Wizard
  
In the case that the user is unsure of what kind of wine they would like,
by clicking on the WIZARD button, they will be redirected to a wine suggester
that will allow the user to input the type, varietal, price range, and vintage
range that they are interested in. Once the wizard has done its magic, the 
user will be able to favourite any wine returned, give them ratings, and add
them to their personal Cellars.


  E00. Cellar
  
When the user clicks on the CELLAR button at the top of their dashboard, they
will be redirected to their personal inventory system, the Cellar. Here, the
user can peruse their inventory for wines, being able to add, remove, and favourite
them at will.


  F00. Winebook

Once a user is logged in, they can click on the WINEBOOK tab from the header.
They will be redirected to the Winebook page.


  F01. Adding an Entry
  
From the Winebook page, the user can click the ADD AN ENTRY tab on the side of the
screen and enter a title, body, and a photograph for uploading. The user will have to
refresh the browser window in order to see the entry after it is added.


  G00. Logging Out
  
In order to log out, all the user has to do is click LOG OUT at the top of the
screen. They will then be redirected to the front page.


  H00. Miscellaneous Notes
  
Whenever a wine is displayed, the user will be able to hover over that
particular wine and view more details about it. By clicking on the wine,
the user will be able to adjust its quantity in their cellar, add a rating,
view its description, and mark it as a favourite. The user can drag the
pop-up description box to anywhere on the screen or close it at their 
dicretion. All wine galleries shift left and right.
